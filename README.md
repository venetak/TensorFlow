# Playground TensorFlow Repository

This repository serves as a playground for learning and experimenting with TensorFlow.

## Projects
- **Handwritten Digit Recognition Neural Network**:  
The first project is a neural network designed to recognize handwritten numbers (such as those from the MNIST dataset).  
- Uses the ReLU activation function.
- Training is configured to stop once 98% accuracy is achieved.

## More
Additional experiments and projects may be added to further explore TensorFlow's capabilities and deepen understanding.
